%Beschreibung des Problems
The number of entries in the Internet core Routing tables goes a long 
with the number of edge networks with provider independent addresses. 
For most of the edge networks operators it seems pretty reasonable to 
use PI addresses, as only by using them multihoming becomes an options for real 
redundancy and as well changing the provider, for whatever reason, 
can be done without renumbering the entire Network, which would usually 
cost an enormous amount of men hours. In Advance there are nor real 
disadvantages for edge net operators, when choosing to use PI 
addresses.
